# Vegetable Classification :

## Overview

Vegetable Classification is a critical process in Agriculture and Food Processing. This project employs a Supervised Learning technique, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition and classification tasks. The model is trained to recognize and categorize vegetables based on their visual features.

## Tech Stack

   •	**TensorFlow:** 
   
   > A powerful open-source machine learning library used for building and training neural network models. 
   
   •	**Streamlit:** 
   
   > A Python library for creating web applications with interactive user interface.
   
   •	**PIL (Pillow):**
   
   > Python Imaging Library, used for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats.
   
   •	**Matplotlib:** 
   
   > A plotting library for creating static data visualizations in Python.
   
   •	**NumPy:** 
   
   > Essential for numerical operations, especially in handling image data arrays.
   
   •	**TensorFlow Hub:** 
   
   > A repository of pre-trained machine learning models, providing modules and tools for building ML applications.
